# DeepBind_with_Tensorflow

A TensorFlow implementation of DeepBind model is proposed. DeepBind is a deep learning model using convolutional neural networks used for predicting TF binding sites. The model was proposed in the paper ["Predicting the sequence specificities of DNA and RNA-binding proteins by deep learning"](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3300) published in 2015.

The architecture of the model and the calibration phase steps are explained in this figure from the paper:
